## Optimization

 
Concepts tested by this program:

+ Inheritance
+ Interfaces
+ Polymorphism
  - Abstract classes
  - Overriding methods
+ JUnit Tests
+ Optimization of functions by estimation 

NOTE: This project requires attention to detail. Follow the following instructions carefully.

In this project, you will extend the graphing application developed in Lab 9 to estimate the optimal solution(s) to three optimization problems presented in the MATH 181 YouTube videos by Dr Jason Lee entitled “Math 181 Section 4.6” (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL94c6yqxunA3fz2AJ7TzMehUcb08JuJjz).  This application will replace functions #1, #2, and #3 with the three functions developed in the videos for finding local extrema, and iterate over them from a left extent to a right extent to find the minimum or maximum.  It will report the results, and continue on to graph the function using the same methods developed in the previous project.  Based on good object-oriented programming practices, the function definitions can easily be changed, so design and programming tasks are focused on iterating through the function to find the local extrema.
